# RotateJS
A simple WebGL program that textures a cube and rotates it.

# Usage
Create a canvas with id "gl-canvas"
Set your canvas dimensions
Create a image/video element with id "rotateIt"
Have fun.

# Note
Because of browser security settings, you may need to run this in a webserver to access textures.

# WARNING
This is not finished, optimized, or clean. I pushed this to get people off my back and I'll get around to fleshing it out when I have time.
