# RotateJS
A simple WebGL program that textures a cube and rotates it.

# Usage
Include the scripts that are in index.html<br/>
Create a canvas with id "gl-canvas"<br/>
Set your canvas dimensions<br/>
Create a image/video element with id "rotateIt"<br/>
Have fun.<br/>

# TODO
- Allow for configurable rotation parameters.
- Allow for face texture specification.
- Support for multiple cubes (hopefully n).
- Change shader linking to external files.

# Note
Because of browser security settings, you may need to run this in a webserver to access textures.

# WARNING
This is not finished, optimized, or clean. I pushed this to get people off my back and I'll get around to fleshing it out when I have time.
